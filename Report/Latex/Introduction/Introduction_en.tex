	About this topic, the field of Drone in particular and embedded field in general, Camera streaming
	 is important to supervisors and processing data. IP camera is too big and consumes more power. 
	 Therefore, the embedded camera is more flexible and doesn't need high-performance microprocessor. 
	 At this topic, We are using the OV7670 camera module and STM32F466RE to processing raw data. Raw data
	 after compress to jpeg format which will transfer to PCs through Uart and display on the screen.
